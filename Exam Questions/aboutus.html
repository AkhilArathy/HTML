	<p>The Communists have studied, in detail, the role and functions of media in the society. Karl Marx  started his journalist career by doing articles for the radical newspaper <q>Rheinische Zeitung</q> in 1848. Class struggle is common in economic, political and cultural spheres. The media serves as the roof of economic stability. The struggles in economic sector will reflect on the roof as well.</p>

	<p>Media itself is venue of a class struggle. Media in Kerala had reflected labour class struggles from the latter's nascent stage. Inspired by the Bolshevik revolution,Congress socialists began organising labour and farmer classes. There was a widespread campaign against Congress socialists then. This forced its leaders to think of using media to achieve their goals and it resulted in the origin of Prabhatham, the first Communist newspaper in Kerala was brought out in January 1935. Though the newspaper lasted for a short period it played a big role in Kerala's social progress.</p>


	<p>EMS recorded thus: We used Prabhatham for analysing issues faced by Kerala and to raise our opinions Our major responsibilities included encouraging labour agitations and other public protests which were in initial stages.  On the political front, we published reports on clashes between the left and right wings in the KPCC C and also the stand of Congress Socialists on those issues. Prabhatham helped in spreading messages that boosted social progress. It also detailed the progress of agrarian movements.</p>



	<p>The government then adopted a stand to control activities that helped social progress and banned  Prabhatham. But, it could realise the Marxist concept of newspapers taking the roles of an agitator and organiser. In 1938, the printing of Prabhatham resumed in Kozhikode but its permission was revoked after the start of Second World War. These developments throw light into the hardships faced by the the party in campaigning during that period.</p>


	<p>Deshabhimani was first published as a monthly on 6 September 1942 in Kozhikode. It actively involved  in political issues then. After the hanging of Kayyur comrades on 29 March 1943, Deshabhimani published an editorial titled "Thookkumarathinte Vili" (The call of the gallows). This provoked the Britishers who imposed a fine of Rs 1000. The massive public support helped Deshabhimani to collect the money in no time.</p>
