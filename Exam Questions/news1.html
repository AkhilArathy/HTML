	<p>In the over two-hour-long podcast, which was released on Friday on YouTube, the Prime Minister said that everyone makes mistakes, including him.</p>
	<p>Recalling a speech he had delivered as chief minister of Gujarat, Modi told Kamath: <q>When I became the chief minister, I gave a speech in which I said, 'I will not shy away from hard work' and 'I will not do anything for myself' and 'I am human who can make mistakes, but I will never do anything wrong with bad intentions.' This is my life's Mantra. Everyone makes mistakes, including me. After all, I am a human being, not some God,</q> Modi said in the podcast.</p>

	<p>Reacting to the remarks, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh said that the statement is coming from the Prime Minister who had <q>proclaimed his non-biological status</q> before the 2024 Lok Sabha election.

Ramesh was referring to a remark by Modi in an interview that he had been <q>sent by God</q>.</p>
